### What is a Galois field? A **Galois field** (named after Évariste Galois) is a field that contains a **finite** number of elements. When mathematicians say “field” they mean a set in which you can add, subtract, multiply, and divide (except by zero) and all the familiar algebraic laws hold. The finite fields that exist are precisely the fields \[ \mathbb{F}_{p^n}\qquad (p\ \text{prime},\; n\ge 1) \] Every element of \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\) can be represented as a polynomial of degree at most \(n-1\) with coefficients in the prime field \(\mathbb{F}_p=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\). The size of the field is \(p^n\). --- ### Basic properties | Property | Description | |-----------|-------------| | **Characteristic** | The smallest positive integer \(m\) for which \(1+1+\dots+1=m\cdot1=0\). For \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\) this characteristic is \(p\). | | **Subfields** | \(\mathbb{F}_{p^m}\) is a subfield of \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\) iff \(m\) divides \(n\). | | **Multiplicative group** | The non‑zero elements of \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\) form a cyclic group of order \(p^n-1\). | | **Uniqueness** | For each prime power \(q=p^n\) there is, up to isomorphism, exactly one field with \(q\) elements, denoted \(\mathbb{F}_{q}\) or \(GF(q)\). | | **Construction** | Take the ring \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\) of polynomials over \(\mathbb{F}_p\); mod out by any irreducible polynomial of degree \(n\). The quotient is \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\). | | **Order arithmetic** | Addition and multiplication are performed modulo \(p\) on the coefficients, and multiplication by a polynomial modulo an irreducible polynomial of degree \(n\). | --- ### Examples | Field | Representation | Size | |-------|----------------|------| | \(\mathbb{F}_{2}\) | \(\{0,1\}\) with arithmetic mod 2 | 2 | | \(\mathbb{F}_{4}\) | \(\{0,1,\alpha,\alpha+1\}\) where \(\alpha^2+\alpha+1=0\) | 4 | | \(\mathbb{F}_{8}\) | Polynomial modulus \(\alpha^3+\alpha+1=0\) over \(\mathbb{F}_2\) | 8 | | \(\mathbb{F}_{2^8}\) used in AES | Polynomials modulo an irreducible degree‑8 polynomial over \(\mathbb{F}_2\) | 256 | --- ### Why are they useful? - **Error‑correcting codes:** Linear codes over \(\mathbb{F}_q\) (e.g., Reed–Solomon, BCH, LDPC) rely on the arithmetic of finite fields to encode and decode data with redundancy, protecting it against corruption. - **Cryptography:** Block ciphers such as AES use arithmetic in \(\mathbb{F}_{2^8}\). Public‑key protocols such as Elliptic‑Curve Diffie‑Hellman use points on curves defined over finite fields. - **Computer algebra & algorithms:** Finite fields give a concrete, algorithmically tractable domain in which to implement constructive logic, theorem proving, and symbolic computation (e.g., Gröbner bases, polynomial factoring). - **Pure mathematics:** The theory of finite fields underlies many areas—Galois theory, algebraic geometry over finite fields (e.g., Weil conjectures), group theory (classification of finite simple groups), representation theory, and more. --- ### Quick construction algorithm (for \(\mathbb{F}_{p^n}\)) 1. Pick a prime \(p\) and polynomial irreducible of degree \(n\) over \(\mathbb{F}_p\). 2. Work in the polynomial ring \(\mathbb{F}_p[x]\). 3. Define field operations modulo the chosen irreducible polynomial. Because all fields of the same size are isomorphic, any two choices of irreducible polynomial over \(\mathbb{F}_p\) lead to essentially the same field (structure‑wise); the specific polynomial only affects the labels of the elements. --- **In a nutshell:** A Galois field is a finite, all‑standard field, the size of which is a power of a prime. Their arithmetic is simple (polynomial quotient), but their structure—particularly the fact that the multiplicative group is cyclic—makes them ideal for coding theory, cryptography, and many domains of discrete mathematics.
